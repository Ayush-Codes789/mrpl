"""
Config-driven model registry. Adding a model means adding a YAML entry in
registry.yaml, not touching this file or the router. get_candidates()
returns the best-fit models for a task type, ranked by benchmark_score,
optionally filtered to what fits in the available VRAM.

The parsed YAML is cached (lru_cache) so the file is only read and parsed
once per process — call reload_registry() after editing the YAML by hand
during development to pick up changes without restarting.
